# 2048
A small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone). 2048 was indirectly inspired by [Threes](https://asherv.com/threes/).

Made just for fun. still learning basic web programming, inspired from [2048 Game | Javascript Project With Source Code](https://youtu.be/I46Jf4o8r1w?si=giMw8HEViGKJByPY) with some modification with ES modules and scss, you can check on branches.

The official app can also be found on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gabrielecirulli.app2048) and [App Store!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2048-by-gabriele-cirulli/id868076805)
